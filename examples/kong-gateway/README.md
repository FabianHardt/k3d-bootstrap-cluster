# Kong API Gateway

### Precondition

Cluster has to be deployed with the *Hashicorp Vault* sample . Otherwise this demo wouldn't work, because it needs the autogenerated TLS certificates.

**Kong Enterprise: ** If you want to install the Kong Enterprise mode, you will need to add a file named `license.json`in the folder `examples/kong-gateway`.

### Installation
